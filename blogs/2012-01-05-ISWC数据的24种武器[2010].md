原文写于2010-11-08http://tw.rpi.edu/weblog/2010/11/08/15-ways-to-explore-iswc-2010-data/15 (and counting) Ways to Explore ISWC 2010 DataThis year at ISWC, when we worked on the metadata, we have a Data Consuming task force to develop tools that can browse/visualize the data many different ways, e.g., faceted browser, filter browser and mobile browser.As soon as we have the basic dataset published, we immediately get feedback from people on off-the-shelf tools that can work with the data. The list is quickly growing. I collected the screen shots of some working instances (including tools the metadata committee has built) in a slides. I have no doubt that the number “15″ will be changed when the main conference begins …. in 2.5 hours! So expect some updates very quick.What strikes me is that the number and diversity of data browsers currently available, and many of them are clearly reaching the level of maturity for non-expert users to explore. That was not the case even one year ago. So much has been changed for the Semantic Web in 2010!P.S. 2012-01-05 later I added more browsing tools, making the count 24.[slideshare id=5700888&doc=15waystoexploreiswc2010data-101108040248-phpapp02]
