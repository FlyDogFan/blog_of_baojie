The Card is meant to be a “cheat sheet” of OWL 2 features printable on a single piece of paper (on both sides). It is based on the OWL 2 Quick Reference Guide [1], which is now a Proposed Recommendation [2] in the OWL 2 Web Ontology Language document set.Background: OWL 2 [4] is an extension to OWL 1 with a few new functionalities. Some of the new features are syntactic sugar (e.g., disjoint union of classes) while others offer new expressivity, including:* keys; * property chains; * richer datatypes, data ranges; * qualified cardinality restrictions; * asymmetric, reflexive, and disjoint properties; and * enhanced annotation capabilities     Comments and suggestions to the Card are welcome (please send to public-owl-comments@w3.org)[1] http://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/refcard[2] http://www.w3.org/2007/OWL/wiki/Quick_Reference_Guide[3] http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/PR-owl2-quick-reference-20090922/[4] http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/Jie Bao
