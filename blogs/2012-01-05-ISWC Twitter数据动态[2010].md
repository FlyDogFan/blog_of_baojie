At ISWC 2010, there are several on-going efforts to leverage Twitter data. Some ones that I’m aware of are:

Joshua Shinavier has helped to build a triple store (powered by AllegroGraph) that contains tweets related to the conference, along with basic ISWC metadata. Here is an example of SPARQLing with the triple store (details about tweets with tag #iswc2010 and #iswc). More examples and guide on how to use the triple store will be out soon.

Marian Dörk helped us to visualize tweets at ISWC. You can see the relative traffic by time, the distribution of buzz words at the conference, and who is twittering about what. Marian is looking into interviewing our attendees for the tool – if you have comment, let him (mdoerk@ucalgary.ca) or me know (baojie@cs.rpi.edu)
