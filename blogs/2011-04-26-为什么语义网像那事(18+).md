Why is XYZ like teenage sex?这是老段子了，可以用在任何技术的初期阶段。版本很多，XYZ可以是语义网，敏捷编程，云计算，等等。对语义网，我倒觉得很贴切。我看到最早的版本是这样的It’s on everyone’s mind all the time. 每个人都老想着这事Everyone is talking about it all the time.  每个人都谈这破事Everyone thinks everyone else is doing it. 每个人都觉得别人做了。Almost no one is really doing it. 很少有人真干了The few who are doing it are: 那些少数做过的doing it poorly 做得很菜hopeful it will be better next time 希望下次能做得更好not practicing it safely 不晓得安全得去做Everyone is bragging about their successes all the time, although very few have actually had any success. 人人都在吹嘘自己并不存在的成功另一个版本也部分适用（我挑了几条） It’s Not the Size of the Tool, It’s How You Use It 不要怪工具的尺码，关键是你自己会不会用Foreplay is Key 前戏很重要Everyone’s an “Expert” (Or “Guru” or “Ninja”) 大师满地走，专家不如狗You Need to Do More Than Just Show Up; You’ve Got to Engage 光晃悠不行，要死缠烂打，深入回头再复习一下黄夏留教授的经典语录，或许有异曲同工之处。【同Net.Weblog.20050228】
