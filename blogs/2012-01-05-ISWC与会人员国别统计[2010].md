### ISWC 2010 Attendees by Country

This is a preliminary stat of ISWC attendees by country. Data is from registration list as of Oct 28, 2010, and the final data may be a little different. Also note that it’s different from the author/organizer data.

By no surprise, the host country China has the most attendees (15.4%). US, UK and Germany follow as the next biggest players (14.9%, 14.4%, 12.6%), respectively. By continents, we have
 
Europe: 60.05%   
Asia: 21.69%   
Americas: 17.72%   
Australia: 1.06%   
Africa: 0.53%   
Antarctica: 0% – not surprising, isn’t it ?

Clearly, Europe is still the most active in Semantic Web research. We also see this fact by various other statistics, e.g., [orgnaizations involved in recent semantic web events](data.semanticweb.org/organization).

The following tools are used:

- The original data is in spreadsheet. Countries are given in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code, e.g., Netherlands is NL, which many people are not familiar with. I found the code-to-name mapping from [another source](http://geotags.com/iso3166/countries.html). However, as Excel can’t do join, I imported the two csvs into one RDF file using TopBraid Composer (here is [how](http://www.topquadrant.com/composer/videos/tutorials/spreadsheets/import.html)).
- A SPARQL query is used to do the join, the result is saved as a Google Docs spreadsheet.
- The spreadsheet is visualized by [Datapress](http://projects.csail.mit.edu/datapress/).

The SPARQL query I used

```
SELECT count(?subject) ?n 
WHERE { 
?subject a :Person ; :country [:name ?n] . 
}
GROUP BY ?n
```

From the end user point of view, while all the tools I used are wonderful, what I really wish to have is some integrated environment that I can do all the above together, ideally all in browser – and even more ideally – I don’t have to know that there are RDF and SPARQL underneath, just like now I don’t have to worry about Javascript, JSON or Google Charts since they are all hidden from the interface.

It’s really likely that I missed some tools that can do the job easier, as semantic tools have been mushroomed in the recent years. I will keep looking for better ways to visualize ISWC data – in the end, I wish everyone, especially non-prorammers, can do it. That will show the most of the beauty of semantics. I believe we are very close to that.
