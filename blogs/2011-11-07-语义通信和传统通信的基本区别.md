引自我正在写的一篇文章:

A semantic information source or destination has a background knowledge base and is able to infer implicit facts from explicitly given facts. The key difference from the classical information theory is that in our semantic information theory, messages are expressions which can be true or false. We are interested in studying how often a message is true and how its truthhood can be preserved in communication; on the other hand, classical information theory studies how often a message appears and how precise its lexical form can be restored in communication.
