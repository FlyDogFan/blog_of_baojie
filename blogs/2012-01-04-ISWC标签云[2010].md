原文写于2010-11-02A Word Cloud for ISWC 2010http://tw.rpi.edu/weblog/2010/11/02/a-word-cloud-for-iswc-2010/Sharon Myrtle Paradesi of the DIG group, MIT, has helped us to generate a tag cloud for ISWC 2010. The input is abstracts of papers in the proceedings (i.e., research track, in-use track, doctor consortium track, and invited talks) and poster/demo proceedings. While I don’t know the full details of Sharon’s techniques, she applied a set of NLP algorithms (e.g., stemming, casing, and stop word removal, etc.) to make the cloud.As one may expect, Ontology, Semantic, Data, Query and Web are most visible. OWL, RDF and SPARQL are in comparable size, while RIF is not seen. Also notable to mention that MediaWiki is in the cloud (confession: I’m biased).It would be interesting to compare the evolution of such word clouds of ISWC year by year – ISWC actually has 8 years of metadata since 2003.  I hope Sharon and I will find time to do it sometime in the future.P.S. 2012-01-04 可以和ISWC 2011的标签云做一个比较。注：2011组委会没有用我上面引用的这个2010标签云，而是重做了一个，所以有所不同。图片出处http://semanticweb.com/report-from-day-3-at-iswc_b24204 （by Juan Sequeda）图中的女士是2011大会主席Natasha Noy
